Special traits
--------------
* It relies only in open source technologies. (i.e. no license tracking madness, no license fees) *
* It works on Linux,Windows and OS X (small adjustments may be necesary) *
* It is lightweight. The client runs well in something as minimal as a raspberry pi (and the servers possibly too!)

**\*In the case of using Windows or OS X, you will need to deal with their licenses and fees.**
