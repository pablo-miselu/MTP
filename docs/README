To generate the documentation run:
 sphinx-build -b html <srcDirectory> <dstDirectory>

For example, from this directory running:
 sphinx-build -b html . html

would create a subdirectory "html" containing the documentation.

*IMPORTANT* For this to work you need:
  -Have sphinx installed.
  -The path to the MTP python package inside this repo included in your PYTHONPATH.
